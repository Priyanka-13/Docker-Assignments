  ## Pull some specific version of docker "alpine" image from docker registry.:
  
     sudo docker pull alpine:3.5
     
     
## Run a docker container from local image "alpine" and run an inline command "ls -l" while running container.:
     
     sudo docker run -it alpine ls -l
     
## Try to take login to container created using "alpine" image.:     
     
     sudo docker run -d  --name priyanka-alpine3 alpine tail -f /dev/null
     sudo docker exec -it [container ID] /bin/sh

## Detach yourself from the container without making it exit/container kill.::

    sudo docker run -it alpine /bin/sh  (this will provide the shell of alpine container)
    now press ctrl p+q     (it will detach us from container without exiting it)

## Stop running container.Start container that was stopped earlier.
    
    sudo docker stop [Container ID]
    sudo docker start [Container ID] - it wont go into exited status coz there is a deamon running in this container

##  Try to remove "alpine" image from your local system.

    sudo docker rmi [image id]
